This package constitutes the basic setup for the translator.

What you need to know:
	1) There is a file called "config.sh.tmpl" -- copy it and rename it to "config.sh".
	2) Edit your new config.sh file and change the directory location to point to the ROOT directory of your xtc install (ie. the directory containing the xtc source).
	3) Use the build script to test it out (ie. run: ./make)
	4) You should see a message saying "All compiled!".  If you don't, you did something wrong.
	5) Run: ./make run
	6) You should see "Happy happy, joy joy!"
	7) Congratulations, it's running with ecstasy...err, xtc.

Notes:
	* The "make" script is pretty much an alias for "make".  I made a script so that you don't have to source your config file every time you run make...it would make things too difficult.
	* Remember, it's executed as "./make", not "make" -- one is the local script, the other is the system executable.
