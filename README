This package constitutes the basic setup for the translator.

What you need to know:
	1) There is a file called "config.sh.tmpl" -- copy it and rename it to "config.sh".
	2) Edit your new config.sh file and change the directory location to point to the ROOT directory of your xtc install (ie. the directory containing the xtc source).
	3) Use the build script to test it out (ie. run: ./make)
	4) You should see a message saying "All compiled!".  If you don't, you did something wrong.
	5) Run: ./make run
	6) Congratulations, it's running with ecstasy...err, xtc.

A good start:
	1) Run the translator -- only outputs the out.cpp/h files.
		Command: ./make run file=test1
	2) Run a test case and compare the outputs of the java file and the C++ translation.
		Command: ./make test file=test1
	3) Translate the input file and compile and run the C++
		Command: ./make cpp file=test1
	4) To run a file inside a test package:
		Command: ./make cpp file=test2/add
	5) To run the test suite:
		Command: ./make testSuite
	6) To run Grimm's test:
		Command: ./make test file=xtx/oop/Test
	
Notes:
	* The "make" script is pretty much an alias for "make".  I made a script so that you don't have to source your config file every time you run make...it would make things too difficult.
	* Remember, it's executed as "./make", not "make" -- one is the local script, the other is the system executable. 
	
Coding Conventions:
	* Everything should use tabs (no spaces)
